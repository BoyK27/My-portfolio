# My-portfolio
Here is a driven portfolio which i made for myself so as to test the skills i have acquired in html css and js sofar and it equally thought me alot of new and interesting stuff.
This portfolio project contains the following, 
An Index.html file which carries the skeletal structure of the entire web page and various java script sub codes which are responsible for carrying on a rendering to the page incase the script fails.

The styles.css file which carries the styles for making the page take the required design which I desired for the page.

Then finally we have the render file which is a js file which carries the main logic of the page and all can made clearly vissible
The entire code is well commemnted so as to enable anyone who goes through to understand and modify as per needed.
